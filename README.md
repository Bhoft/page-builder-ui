# Page Builder UI

This is a very basic browser-based drag and drop page builder UI, built with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), and utilizing HTML5 drag and drop to move rows and modules.

I built this simply as a learning exercise, and this code should not be considered production-ready, nor is it an example of any kind of best practice.

You have been warned. :)
