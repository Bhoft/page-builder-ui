# Page Builder UI

This is a very basic browser-based drag and drop page builder UI, built with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [jQuery UI Sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/).

I built this simply as a learning exercise, and this code should not be considered production-ready, nor is it an example of any kind of best practice.
